      Generate more ideas - We’ve all stepped into a conference room for a meeting with no idea what it’s about. It’s never a good experience! If your teammates don’t know the goal, stakes, or benefits of this meeting, it will be harder for them to come equipped with ideas. By organizing a meeting, you increase the chances that people will show up ready to participate.

Generate better ideas - Meetings aren’t just about ideas -- they’re about good ideas. Organize your meetings to empower your teammates to put their best foot forward. If your teammates understand what the meeting is for, what you hope to accomplish, and how it fits into the bigger picture, their ideas will reflect that understanding.

Improve efficiency - Simply put, an organized meeting will take up less time than a disorganized one. And organized meetings take up better time than disorganized meetings. Rather than spending the meeting answering questions about the meeting itself, organized meetings give you space to talk about the things that matter.

Get more people involved - When it comes to discussions, people have different styles and preferences. Many of your teammates might prefer to write down their ideas rather than communicate them orally, for example. An organized meeting gives everyone a chance to contribute in the style of their choice.

Turn disagreements into discussion - In any meeting, disagreements are inevitable. This is far from a bad thing. After all, disagreements help you grow and iterate. But organization is the difference between disagreement and discussion. In a disorganized meeting, your teammates might argue without resolution because they don’t have a good idea of their goal. In a well-organized meeting, your teammates can turn disagreements into productive discussions about how to meet a challenge.
